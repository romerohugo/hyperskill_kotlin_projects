# hyperskill_kotlin_projects

Repo gathering all the projects off the track "Kotlin Developer" on HyperSkill X JetBrains. I just upload the main files of the last stage of each projects because it gathers all the work implemented in the previous steps.

## Cinema project

A simple project that uses the console to prompt the user for a seat in a Cinema and allows him to see the seat arrangement and some statistics.

## Phone book project

A project oriented on learning different sorting and searching techniques and see the difference in time complexity. It is based on a text file gathering a list of phone numbers and names and another one with the names we want to search. We perform different actions on these files to print the number of entries found and the time it took for each technique.
